# Date Night

## Description 

We have created a mobile-responsive web application called date night. Date night gives users a date night idea including an alcoholic drink, a meal recipe and a fun game. Users can chose which type of drink glass they would like their drink to be in, a meal type option and a game genre.  The user is then provided a random selection of each item. If the user does not like their selection, they have the option to reroll. The user is also given the option to email themselves their results. This application gives couples easy and non partisan ideas for a wonderful date night. We learned how to use Bulma to style, how to incorporate multiple APIs and how to create a card flipping function.
